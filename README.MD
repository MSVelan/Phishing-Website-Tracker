# Phishing Website Detector

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook-based project is a Phishing Website Detector that employs machine learning algorithms to classify websites as legitimate or phishing. It utilizes the following algorithms:

| Algorithm            | Accuracy | F-score | Recall | Precision |
|----------------------|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Gradient Boost       | --| --| --| --|
| Random Forest        | --| --| --| --|
| Decision Tree        | --| --| --| --|
| K-nearest neighbor   | --| --| --| --|


## About Phishing Websites

Phishing websites are fraudulent sites designed to impersonate trusted entities, aiming to deceive users into disclosing sensitive information. These websites employ methods such as email phishing, spear phishing, vishing, and smishing.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MSVelan/Phishing-Website-Tracker
   ```

2. 



## Usage
Within the Jupyter Notebook, follow the provided instructions to execute the detector with your preferred algorithm. You will find code cells and explanations to guide you through the process.


## Data
The detector uses a dataset of website features to train and test the models. The dataset should be located in a file named `data.csv`. Ensure that your dataset follows the required format.


## Results
After running the detector within the Jupyter Notebook, you will see the classification results, including accuracy and other relevant metrics, depending on the algorithm used. These results will help you assess the detector's performance.
